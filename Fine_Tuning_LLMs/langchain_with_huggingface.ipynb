In response, an English journalist, Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett, proposed that the next Australian team to visit England should be challenged to a contest for the ashes.\\n\\nThe first Ashes series was held in 1889, with England regaining the Ashes. Since then, the trophy has been contested in every Test series between the two countries. The team that holds the Ashes is said to have the ‘wooden urn’, which is made of wood and lined with a velvet interior and has a gold urn on the lid. The trophy is currently in England’s possession after they won the 2019 Ashes series 2-2.'"

The last number ends in 0, and the first number ends in 1, so there are 89 - 10 + 1 = 81 numbers in this range.2. Each ten has 10 possible unit digits, and 5 is one of them, so the number of desired numbers is 81 * 1/10 = 8.1. However, since we can't have a fraction of a number, we need to round this value up to the nearest integer, which is 9.3. Therefore, the percentage of numbers from 11 to 90 with a unit digit of 5 is (9/81) * 100 = 11.11%, but since we can't have a percentage less than 10%, the closest answer is 10%.Hence, the answer is A. 10%.\""

            "Please enter your quory: What is soccer\n",
            "? Soccer is a popular sport played between two teams, each consisting of eleven players. The objective of the game is to score goals by getting the ball into the opposing team's net while preventing the other team from doing the same. Soccer is often referred to as football in many parts of the world, and it is the most widely-played sport globally.\n",
            "\n",
            "History of Soccer:\n",
            "Soccer originated in England in the early 19th century, although its origins can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as China, Greece, and Rome. The modern form of soccer emerged in England when the Football Association was formed in 1863, and it established a set of rules for the game. Soccer quickly gained popularity in Europe and spread to other parts of the world, becoming a global phenomenon in the 20th century.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rules of Soccer:\n",
            "Soccer is played on a rectangular field with a goalpost at each end. The field is typically around 100-130 yards long and 50-100 yards wide. The game begins with a kickoff, which is taken by one team from the center of the field. The other team then tries to gain possession of the ball and advance it towards the opposing team's goal. Players can only use their feet, knees, chest, and head to move the ball. They are not allowed to use their hands or arms to touch the ball deliberately, except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area.\n",
            "\n",
            "Scoring Points:\n",
            "A goal is scored when the ball is completely crossed over the goal line between the goalposts and under the crossbar. Each team is allowed a maximum of eleven players on the field at any given time, including the goalkeeper. The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins. If the game is tied, it may go into extra time or a penalty shootout to determine the winner.\n",
            "\n",
            "Equipment:\n",
            "Soccer players wear a jersey, shorts, socks, and cleats. The ball used in soccer is round and typically made of leather or synthetic materials. Goalposts are made of metal or plastic and are usually around 8 yards apart.\n",
            "\n",
            "Conclusion:\n",
            "Soccer is a fascinating and exciting sport that has captured the hearts of people all over the world. With its rich history, simple rules, and high level of skill and athleticism\n",
